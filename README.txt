Welcome!!
In this repository i developed a aplication in c++. Sort a list of numbers almacenated in a paginated array. However the program run with a limit in the memory ram of the computer

To use the aplication you need to run the executable file with the current command
./<executable> -i <inputFileName.csv> -a |SS or IS or QS| -o <outputFileName.csv>
